I ended a relationship with a boy several days ago. He is gay, I knew this from the very begining, and I told him i am not gay on the first day we met. So, when he got attached to me later, I thought he would treat me like a normal friend and refrain from any sexual intentions. I was wrong. About one week after we knew each other, he proposed traveling to my home city during the upcoming May Day holiday, which was only a few days away. I was okay with that, but was suddenly suprised when he accidentally chose the nearst hotel to my home -- I guess he didn't know where my home was. I was not prepared to bring him to my home, so I had only planned to take him to some public places and hang out, just as new friends usually do. Today, while I am recalling what happened between us and how my thoughts changed during that period, a question occurs to me. A relationship of what kind do I need or want?

I broke up with my ex-girlfriend because I felt the relationship was too clingy and my freedom was restricted. More peronsal time and space -- that's what I realized I needed, and it was of great importance to me. With this idea in mind, I chose to spend most of my time either alone or with my friends, instead of indulging in an intimate relationship. I went to Macau as an exchange student for half a year, met new friends, and traveled alone to four countries. That kind of new life was wonderful, full of stimulation and happiness, but something felt missing. The thing I find important to me is close companionship, in a form that is perhaps a bit idealized. I know there is no way to go back to that sort of relationship anymore.

So how about staying and doing things with friends? Is it better than the old lifestyle? Here I encounter another problem: the space I gained after freeing myself from strong bonds now seems to separate me from engaging closely with friends. Anyway, friendship also needs deliberate maintenance from time to time; otherwise, it will fade away. The crucial problem is, I've never really known how to maintain such friendships. Meanwhile, although I sense that having some friendships is necessary, one needs a strong enough reason to choose to maintain a friendship with a specific person rather than others. These considerations increase the difficulties i face when deciding whether to make the first move.
