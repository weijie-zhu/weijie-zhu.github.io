## Introduction

Yesterday, while watching the film *Interstellar*, I suddenly thought that a philosophical revolution is not only possible but likely in the near future. Before that, I held a negative attitude toward the feasibility of solving long-standing philosophical issues, such as the mind-body dilemma and other similar profound problems. This sudden shift in my perspective is due to realizing how significantly science has changed our view of the world during the transition to modern thinking.

Therefore, in this paper, I aim to explore the possibility of a philosophical revolution akin to the scientific revolutions that have reshaped our understanding of the world and the universe over the past few centuries. In addition, I will examine the impact of the scientific revolution and discuss what an equivalent progress in philosophy might look like and its potential influence.

## **How did the Scientific Revolution reshape humanityâ€™s view of the world?**

Could people living in medieval times have imagined a life fully equipped with advanced technology and the profound insights into the universe that we have now? After reviewing some recorded thoughts and existing works, the answer for the majority of people at that time is simply no. At that point in history, the dominant worldview was TBC (refer to the historical overview of the main philosophical and common-sense views of the world). When compared to the understanding of the world held by educated individuals today, a significant gap becomes apparent.

A reasonable answer presented by common sense nowadays was under question for people before the scientific revolution happened from xx to xx century. These questions, this knowledge were not indifferent to them, it was just they were not able to probe into the knots or cut them. Though they kept struggling in those mires, these niche areas have become obsolete and are rarely revisited by modern minds. The mind-body, matter-life, quantity-quality problems may follow a similar path and lead to dryness without more precipitation. No matter how seemingly impossible it is to address these issues, a great revolution that might take place in philosophy could transform the situation in a far-reaching and radical way.

## What knotty problems are under tackling in philosophy which could cause profound influence?

todo: ask AI to summarize them. 

Biology & Physics; Artificial intelligence & Biology    From matter to life to artificial intelligence

## What's the possible strategy or path to address these big issues? My theory.

Evolution and development

Evolution as a way of creating autonomous development sequences. What does it mean? -- New principles playing in that new sequences. 

When do novel things come into play?

The history of researching on systems

Quantify this evolution and development theory: find mathematical relations of hierarchical systems in their respective levels. For example, how large mathematical gap could cause a totally different system dominated by new principles? From atoms to molecules, from molecules to organisms, from organisms to others, also in virtual systems.
