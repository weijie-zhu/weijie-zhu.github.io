## Introduction

Yesterday, when i was watching the film Interstellar, suddenly i thought philosophy revolution is possible even probable in the near future. Before that, i hold negative attitude to the feasibility of solving long-standing philosphical issues like mind-body dilemma and other similar big topics. The sudden change of my attitude to the possibility of great achievements on these problems is caused by realizing how significant has science changed our view of the entire world in the transition to modern mind.

Now, i want to articulate how large the impact of science revolution is, and what might an equivalent progress in philosphy be and the potential influence further.
