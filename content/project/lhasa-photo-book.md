## Overview

This project explores a calm, monochrome-forward visual language for documenting streets, mountains, and daily life in Lhasa.

## Goals

- Build a 48-page layout with clear pacing.
- Keep image treatment consistent across lighting conditions.
- Export both print-ready and mobile-friendly versions.

## What I Tried

I compared two sequencing systems:

1. Chronological timeline.
2. Mood-based grouping (texture, distance, portrait, pause).

The second approach produced a stronger rhythm between pages.

## Result

- Final draft delivered in two versions: print and screen.
- Shared with a small test group and collected reading feedback.
