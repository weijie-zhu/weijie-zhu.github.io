## Problem

The old portfolio had strong images but weak scanning behavior on mobile.

## Scope

- Simplify navigation labels.
- Improve text contrast and spacing.
- Keep images sharp while reducing payload size.

## Current Progress

- Navigation and section hierarchy drafted.
- First pass image optimization completed.
- Writing pass still pending for About and Project pages.

## Next Steps

1. Add project case-study pages.
2. Tune typography for long-form reading.
3. Run final performance check before publishing.
